# framework-with-ts

In this project I have created Framework in Typescript. Inspiration is from Backbone.js and Marionette.

This is based on TypeScript.

This is a Demo project for learning purpose.

Run this project via following commands:

```
 - npm i
 - npm i -g parcel-bundler concurrently json-server
 - npm start
```
